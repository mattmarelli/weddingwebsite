          After the reception (9:00PM) the newlyweds will be heading to downtown Spokane to celebrate!<br/>

          The Montvale Hotel: <a href='https://montvalespokane.com/' target='_blank'>https://montvalespokane.com/</a><br/>
          Hotel Ruby: <a href='https://www.hotelrubyspokane.com/' target='_blank'>https://www.hotelrubyspokane.com/</a><br/>

          <br/>
          If you don't plan to go out after the wedding, we recommend staying somewhere outside of the city to save money<br/>
